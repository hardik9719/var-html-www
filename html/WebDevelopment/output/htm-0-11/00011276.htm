  and on the media label, substantially similar to the following:<br>
  NOTICE OF RESTRICTED RIGHTS<br>
  &quot;Programs delivered subject to the DOD FAR Supplement are 'commercial computer 
  software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, 
  shall be subject to the licensing restrictions set forth in the applicable Oracle 
  license agreement. Otherwise, programs delivered subject to the Federal Acquisition 
  Regulations are 'restricted computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure 
  of the programs, including documentation, shall be subject to the restrictions 
  in FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights (June 1987). 
  Oracle Corporation, 500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065.&quot;</p>
<p><b>End of Agreement</b><br>
  You may terminate this agreement by destroying all copies of the programs. We 
  have the right to terminate your right to use the programs if you fail to comply 
  with any of the terms of this agreement, in which case you shall destroy all 
  copies of the programs.</p>
<p>Relationship Between the Parties<br>
  The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor. Neither party 
  will represent that it has any authority to assume or create any obligation, 
  express or implied, on behalf of the other party, nor to represent the other 
  party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity. Nothing in this 
  agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to independently 
  develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party's 
  products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not included 
  in such software.</p>
<p><b>Open Source</b><br>
  &quot;Open Source&quot; software - software available without charge for use, 
  modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the 
  user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source software or any software 
  that the user 'combines' with the Open Source software freely available in source 
  code form. If you use Open Source software in conjunction with the programs, 
  you must ensure that your use does not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations 
  of us with respect to the Oracle programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, 
  to any third party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property 
  or proprietary rights in the Oracle programs. For example, you may not develop 
  a software program using an Oracle program and an Open Source program where 
  such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle 
  program and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) 
  if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any &quot;modifications&quot; 
  be made freely available. You also may not combine the Oracle program with programs 
  licensed under the GNU General Public License (&quot;GPL&quot;) in any manner 
  that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle program 
  or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL.</p>
<p><b>Entire Agreement</b><br>
  You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs and 
  licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements 
  or representations. If any term of this agreement is found to be invalid or 
  unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.</p>
