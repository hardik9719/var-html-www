<h1>LaTeX Line and Page Breaking</h1>

 The first  thing  LaTeX  does  when  processing  ordinary  text  is to
 translate  your input  file into a string  of glyphs  and spaces.   To
 produce a printed document, this string must be broken into lines, and
 these lines must be broken into pages.   In some environments,  you do
 the line breaking yourself with the \\ command, but LaTeX usually does
 it for you. The available commands are
<ul>
  <li><a href="#linebr"><tt>\\</tt></a> start a new paragraph.
  <li><a href="#linebr"><tt>\\*</tt></a> start a new line but not a new
      paragraph.
  <li><a href="#hyph"><tt>\-</tt></a> OK to hyphenate a word here.
  <li><a href="#clrdblpage">\cleardoublepage</a> flush all material and
       start a new page, start new odd numbered page.
  <li><a href="#clrpage">\clearpage</a> plush all material and start a new
       page.
  <li><a href="#hyphw">\hyphenation</a> enter a sequence pf exceptional
       hyphenations.
  <li><a href="#linebreak">\linebreak</a> allow to break the line here.
  <li><a href="#newline">\newline</a> request a new line.
  <li><a href="#newpage">\newpage</a> request a new page.
  <li><a href="#nolinebreak">\nolinebreak</a> no line break should happen
         here.
  <li><a href="#nopagebreak">\nopagebreak</a> no page break should happen
         here.
  <li><a href="#pagebreak">\pagebreak</a> encourage page break.
</UL>

<h3><a name="linebr">\\</a></h3>
<pre>
 \\[*][extra-space]
</pre>
 The \\ command  tells LaTeX to start  a new line.   It has an optional
 argument, extra-space, that specifies how much extra vertical space is
 to be inserted before the next line.  This can be a negative amount.
<p>
 The \\* command is the same as the ordinary  \\ command except that it
 tells LaTeX not to start a new page after the line.

<hr>
<h3><a name="hyph">\-</a></h3>
 The \- command  tells  LaTeX  that it may hyphenate  the word  at that
 point.   LaTeX is very good at hyphenating,  and it will usually  find
 all correct  hyphenation  points.   The  \- command  is used  for  the
 exceptional cases, as e.g.
<pre>
 man\-u\-script
</pre>

<hr>
<h3><a name="clrdblpage">\cleardoublepage</a></h3>
 The \cleardoublepage  command  ends the current  page  and causes  all
 figures  and tables  that  have  so far appeared  in the  input  to be
 printed.  In a two-sided printing style, it also makes the next page a
 right-hand (odd-numbered) page, producing a blank page if necessary.

<hr>
<h3><a name="clrpage">\clearpage</a></h3>
 The \clearpage  command  ends the current  page and causes all figures
 and tables that have so far appeared in the input to be printed.

<hr>
<h3><a name="hyphw">\hyphenation</a></h3>
<pre>
 \hyphenation{words}
</pre>
 The \hyphenation  command declares  allowed hyphenation  points, where
 words  is  a list  of  words,  separated  by  spaces,  in  which  each
 hyphenation point is indicated by a - character, e.g.
<pre>
  \hyphenation{man-u-script man-u-stripts ap-pen-dix}
</pre>

<hr>
<h3><a name="linebreak">\linebreak</a></h3>
<pre>
 \linebreak[number]
</pre>
 The \linebreak  command  tells LaTeX to break the current  line at the
 point of the command.   With the optional  argument,  number,  you can
 convert the \linebreak command from a demand to a request.  The number
 must  be a number  from  0 to 4.  The  higher  the  number,  the  more
 insistent the request is.
<p>
 The \linebreak  command causes LaTeX to stretch the line so it extends
 to the right margin.

<hr>
<h3><a name="newline">\newline</a></h3>
 The \newline  command breaks the line right where it is.  The \newline
 command can be used only in paragraph mode.

<hr>
<h3><a name="newpage">\newpage</a></h3>
 The \newpage command ends the current page.

<hr>
<h3><a name="nolinebreak">\nolinebreak</a></h3>
<pre>
 \nolinebreak[number]
</pre>
 The \nolinebreak command prevents LaTeX from breaking the current line
 at the point of the command.  With the optional argument,  number, you
 can convert the \nolinebreak  command from a demand to a request.  The
 number must be a number from 0 to 4.  The higher the number,  the more
 insistent the request is.

<hr>
<h3><a name="nopagebreak">\nopagebreak</a></h3>
<pre>
 \nopagebreak[number]
</pre>
 The \nopagebreak command prevents LaTeX form breaking the current page
 at the point of the command.  With the optional argument,  number, you
 can convert the \nopagebreak  command from a demand to a request.  The
 number must be a number from 0 to 4.  The higher the number,  the more
 insistent the request is.


<hr>
<h3><a name="pagebreak">\pagebreak</a></h3>
<pre>
 \pagebreak[number]
</pre>
 The \pagebreak  command  tells LaTeX to break the current  page at the
 point of the command.   With the optional  argument,  number,  you can
 convert the \pagebreak command from a demand to a request.  The number
 must  be a number  from  0 to 4.  The  higher  the  number,  the  more
 insistent the request is.
