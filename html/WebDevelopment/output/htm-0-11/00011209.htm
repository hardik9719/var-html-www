   <h1>401 Unauthorized</h1>
   <p>
    You are not authorized to view this page. If you have not changed
    any configuration files, please examine the file
    <tt>conf/tomcat-users.xml</tt> in your installation. That
    file must contain the credentials to let you use this webapp.
   </p>
   <p>
    For example, to add the <tt>admin-gui</tt> role to a user named
    <tt>tomcat</tt> with a password of <tt>s3cret</tt>, add the following to the
    config file listed above.
   </p>
<pre>
&lt;role rolename="admin-gui"/&gt;
&lt;user username="tomcat" password="s3cret" roles="admin-gui"/&gt;
</pre>
   <p>
    Note that for Tomcat 7 onwards, the roles required to use the host manager
    application were changed from the single <tt>admin</tt> role to the
    following two roles. You will need to assign the role(s) required for
    the functionality you wish to access.
   </p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>admin-gui</tt> - allows access to the HTML GUI</li>
      <li><tt>admin-script</tt> - allows access to the text interface</li>
    </ul>
   <p>
    The HTML interface is protected against CSRF but the text interface is not.
    To maintain the CSRF protection:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>Users with the <tt>admin-gui</tt> role should not be granted the
       <tt>admin-script</tt> role.</li>
    <li>If the text interface is accessed through a browser (e.g. for testing
        since this interface is intended for tools not humans) then the browser
        must be closed afterwards to terminate the session.</li>
   </ul>
 </body>
