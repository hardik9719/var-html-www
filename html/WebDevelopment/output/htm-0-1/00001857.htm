The `iron-location` element manages binding to and from the current URL.

iron-location is the first, and lowest level element in the Polymer team's
routing system. This is a beta release of iron-location as we continue work
on higher level elements, and as such iron-location may undergo breaking
changes.

#### Properties

When the URL is: `/search?query=583#details` iron-location's properties will be:

  - path: `'/search'`
  - query: `'query=583'`
  - hash: `'details'`

These bindings are bidirectional. Modifying them will in turn modify the URL.

iron-location is only active while it is attached to the document.

#### Links

While iron-location is active in the document it will intercept clicks on links
within your site, updating the URL pushing the updated URL out through the
databinding system. iron-location only intercepts clicks with the intent to
open in the same window, so middle mouse clicks and ctrl/cmd clicks work fine.

You can customize this behavior with the `urlSpaceRegex`.

#### Dwell Time

iron-location protects against accidental history spamming by only adding
entries to the user's history if the URL stays unchanged for `dwellTime`
milliseconds.
